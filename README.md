# 🏥 Skin Condition Recognition

Welcome to **Skin Condition Recognition**! This project leverages machine learning and computer vision to identify various skin conditions from medical images. It aims to assist dermatologists and researchers in early detection and diagnosis.

## 📌 Project Overview
- 🔬 **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses deep learning for accurate skin condition classification  
- 📸 **Image-Based Recognition:** Supports various skin conditions, including acne, eczema, melanoma, and psoriasis  
- 🚀 **Fast & Scalable:** Optimized for quick inference and high accuracy  

## 📂 Data Format
The dataset includes skin images labeled with condition categories:
- `Image ID` – Unique identifier  
- `Condition Type` – Label (e.g., "Melanoma", "Psoriasis")  
- `Confidence Score` – Model’s prediction probability  

## 🔧 Installation
To set up the project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Skin-Condition-Recognition.git
cd Skin-Condition-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt

💡 How to Use
- Load an image of a skin condition
- Run the model to classify the condition
- Review the results for potential diagnosis
Example usage in Python:
from model import predict_skin_condition
result = predict_skin_condition("sample_image.jpg")
print(result)


📊 Applications
- Medical Research: Assisting dermatological studies
- Clinical Support: Aiding doctors in preliminary diagnoses
- Public Health Awareness: Educating users on skin health
